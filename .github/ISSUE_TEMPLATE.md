Before creating an issue...

# Are you asking a question?

Please don't file GitHub issues to ask questions.
Try to use the discord channel first: https://discord.gg/n7Ft74f.


# Are you reporting a bug/error?

Please include a test case that demonstrates the issue you're reporting.
This is very critical to maintainers in order to help us see the issue you're seeing.

I already have several existing examples on codesandbox, you can fork one of them
depending on the component you're working on: https://codesandbox.io/u/plouc/sandboxes


# Are you making a feature request?

Provide as much information as possible about your requested feature.
Here are a few questions you may consider answering:

*   What's your use case? (Tell us about your application and what problem you're trying to solve.)
*   What interface do you have in mind? (What new properties or methods do you think might be helpful?)
*   Can you point to similar functionality with any existing libraries or components? (Working demos can be helpful.)
