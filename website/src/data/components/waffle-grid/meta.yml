    This chart shows each value using a small waffle chart,
    meaning each value has its own waffle chart.

    Each cell can represent more than `1`, this is managed via
    the `cellValue` property, it can be used to reduce the number
    of cells displayed, let's say your chart shows
    the repartition of gender for a given salary, you might have
    to deal with high values, then you can say that 1 cell = 100 people
    for example.

    Please note that each waffle chart is a square.

    The responsive alternative of this component is
    `ResponsiveWaffleGrid`.
